# 1
Demonstrates a simple speech to text using free models.
One must install ffmpeg and should add it to environment path variable.

# 2
update: added functionality to directly speech to action. when the recorder starts and let's say we gave an instruction "switch off the light", then the image changes to a light which is in switch off state. applies to other appliances also.
